# Carsi, Ana - Multivariate Reduced-Rank Models
This is a repository to include the reports and code used in a project on canonical correlation analysis for machine learning. The first chapters are introductory to the application on numerical methods that will be applied in the end. This follows a series of continuation on the project of 2023 on PCA.

\\ 1-> CCA fundamentals for high-dimensional data

\\ 2-> Optimization on Matrix Manifolds using the Cholesky Retraction

\\ 3-> Kernel CCA for data visualization (hopefully there code!)
